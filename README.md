# Plagiarism Detector
This is a program that can detect if two document has any similar part using 
some many popular algorithm like : LCS(Lowes Common Subsequence),Edit distance etc.
This program is able to detect if the given project is a regular document
or programming document.
It is also able to detect the programming language type and take actions
based on that.

It is fast and can detect under 5 sec (It can be further improved if needed).

Current this project is under develop.
I am thinking of making this program compatible for following languages:
* C
* CPP
* PYTHON
* JAVA
* JS
* GO
* PHP
* HASKELL [Not sure]
* KOTLIN

Further information about data models, program structure will be provided
via this README file.
